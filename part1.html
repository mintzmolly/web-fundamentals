		<h1><b>Molly's Red Balloon</b></h1>
		<h2><i>Once upon a time, in a land far, far away...</i></h2>
			<p>Molly lived in a city surrounded by tall, tall buildings and many, many people. She was very, very busy, all of the time. She always wanted a puppy to call her own, but owning a dog in a tiny apartment wasn't very feasible finacially or spacially. Nevertheless, she never felt lonely because she carried around a red balloon.
